  ## :computer: A project in progress
  ### PlayGround <br/>
  #### This project was developed as part of an open-source collaboration task.<br/> 
  #### Users can select and enjoy various games on one screen through Pygame. <br/>
  #### https://github.com/jojaeyun/OSS_OpenQuest.git <br/>
  #### Here is a hassle for users to run or download each game separately to enjoy various simple games.<br/>
  #### The project integrates multiple mini-games into a single platform, allowing users to choose and enjoy a variety of games easily and quickly.<br/>
  <br/>

  ## :information_desk_person: The role that someone is playing in the project
